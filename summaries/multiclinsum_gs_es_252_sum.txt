A 48-year-old man, with no relevant history, after a high-energy vehicle collision admitted with severe TT. He evolved with respiratory failure that required intubation and connection to mechanical ventilation (MV). He persisted with high ventilatory requirements, requiring rescue ECMO and transfer to our center. He evolved with gasometric and ventilatory improvement that allowed disconnection on the ten day. There were no bleeding or thrombotic complications during ECMO.
